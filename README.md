# Stackup Quiz
A simple quiz app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. This quiz tests your knowledge of StackUp, a learn-to-earn platform for Web3.

## How to Play
* Click the "Start Quiz" button.
* Carefully read the question and select the correct answer.
* Click the "Submit Answer" button.
* The next question will be displayed.
* Continue answering questions until you reach the end of the quiz.
* Your score will be displayed at the end of the quiz.

### Tips
* Read the questions carefully.
* Take your time and don't rush.
* If you don't know the answer to a question, skip it and come back to it later.
* You can review your answers at any time by clicking the "Review Answers" button.

## Classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements
This quiz app uses the following classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements:
* Classes: The Quiz class is used to represent the quiz itself. It contains properties for the current question, the user's score, and the list of questions. It also has methods for displaying the current question, checking the user's answer, and displaying the quiz results.
* Switch statements: The Quiz class uses a switch statement to check the user's answer to the current question. If the user's answer is correct, the score is incremented. Otherwise, the user is notified that their answer is incorrect.
* Try-catch-finally statements: The Quiz class uses a try-catch-finally statement to handle any errors that may occur while displaying the current question or checking the user's answer.

### Future plans
I plan to add the following features to the Stackie Quiz app in the future:

* More questions
* Support for multiple languages
* A leaderboard to track the scores of all users
